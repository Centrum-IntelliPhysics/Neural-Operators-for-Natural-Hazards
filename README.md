**Data**

The data generated and used in this work has been uploaded [here](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sgoswam4_jh_edu/ElqEfANCWC5BrvojtY_vCHoBF5T_3ZtnVxyQUs3UMDuGVQ?e=OBqf1s). It has three folders: (1) raw data, which has the files generated from OpenSees; preprocessing scripts have been provided to generate the training and testing data, (2) preprocessed data, which contains the training and testing data used for training the neural operators, (3) additional results, which is specifically targeted for the results of DeepFNOnet for the wind problem.
