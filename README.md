**Data**

The data generated and used in this work has been uploaded [here](https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sgoswam4_jh_edu/ElqEfANCWC5BrvojtY_vCHoBF5T_3ZtnVxyQUs3UMDuGVQ?e=OBqf1s). It has three folders: (1) raw data, which has the files generated from OpenSees; preprocessing scripts have been provided to generate the training and testing data, (2) preprocessed data, which contains the training and testing data used for training the neural operators, (3) additional results, which is specifically targeted for the results of DeepFNOnet for the wind problem.

## üìù Overview

This repository contains the code and data for the paper:

> **"Neural Operators for Stochastic Modeling of Nonlinear Structural System Response to Natural Hazards"**  
> [arXiv:2502.11279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11279)

We propose and evaluate **physics-informed neural operator frameworks** to model stochastic response of nonlinear structural systems under seismic and wind excitations. The approach is benchmarked against traditional simulators and surrogate models, achieving high accuracy and generalizability under uncertainty.
